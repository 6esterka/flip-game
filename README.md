# Project Title
Flip Game
# Motivation
This project was made to increase my base knowledges in web developing
# Description
The game is simple. At the initial point you have cards with hidden images on the backside that you can see when you click to the card. Your task is to find the similar images for the most possible short time that was given to you.
#Build Status 
The status of project is ongoing. I want to add some menu for the game and it is actually done.
